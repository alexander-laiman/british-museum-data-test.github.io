### British Museum Archive Visualizer
This website is a demo viewer for the backend functionality of my british museum project.
Using RAG enabled AI search, users can create novel searches to explore the vast archive.

This test website uses a subset of 10,000 items from the chinese artifacts collection, all of which have had their information transformed into a vector embedding, stored with FAISS on a mongo.db backend.
Written in react.
